// Does every payment surface hand the buyer a document, and is that document well formed?
//
// Four surfaces used to take real money and produce nothing: plan subscriptions, script holds, AI
// trailers, and free-access script grants. The failure was silent in the same way the ledger gap was
// — the payment worked, the entitlement landed, and only the buyer noticed there was no receipt.
//
// So this file audits the SOURCE for coverage, and exercises the real schema for correctness. Both
// halves matter: a well-formed invoice nobody issues is worth nothing.
