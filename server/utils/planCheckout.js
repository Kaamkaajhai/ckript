/**
 * Plan checkout: make the ORDER authoritative, never the request body.
 *
 * Both plan verifiers previously checked only the Razorpay signature and then read `tier` and
 * `cycle` straight from `req.body` to decide what to grant. A signature proves that some payment on
 * this merchant account succeeded — nothing about which order, for how much, or by whom. So:
 *
 *   • Pay for Silver (₹399), call verify with tier:"gold"  → Gold granted.
 *   • Pay for a month, call verify with cycle:"annual"     → 365 days granted instead of 30.
 *
 * Both were reachable by any authenticated user with a legitimate cheap payment. The fix is to stamp
 * the plan and billing cycle into the Razorpay order at CREATION time — where the price is computed
 * server-side — and to read them back from the order at verification, ignoring the body entirely.
 * The client can still send anything it likes; nothing downstream reads it.
 *
 * The same shape as the competition-registration guard in competitionController.js, deliberately:
 * one pattern for "prove this payment belongs to this purchase" across the codebase.
