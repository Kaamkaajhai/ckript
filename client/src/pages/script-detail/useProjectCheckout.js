/*
 * useProjectCheckout — the state around the buyer's screenplay purchase (D30).
 *
 * `checkout.js` is what each step IS; this is what a screen has to REMEMBER while the buyer moves
 * through them: which boxes are ticked, whether the gateway script has loaded, whether a payment is
 * in flight, what the server last refused and why, what was unlocked, and — the one that matters —
 * whether there is a charge this browser took but never got verified.
 *
 * It is one hook and not three because the steps are not independent. Creating an order RECORDS the
 * acceptances; a dismissed sheet leaves that record standing, so the next attempt must not re-ask;
 * a verified payment changes the PROJECT (the caller's `refresh` re-reads it) and produces two
 * documents the buyer will want. A screen that wired those together itself would get the fan-out
 * subtly wrong on each platform, which is the mistake D28 and D29 removed from the read and write
 * halves of this same surface.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 * -------------------
 * It never navigates, never renders, never opens a window and never raises a browser dialog. It
 * hands back blobs and lets each platform decide what a "download" means there — a desktop tab and
 * an anchor click, a phone's share sheet or its own viewer. A hook that reached for
 * `window.confirm` would be a hook only a desktop could use, and the old page had exactly one.
