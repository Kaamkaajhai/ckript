/*
 * checkout — the buyer's screenplay purchase, shared by the desktop payment page and the native
 * mobile checkout screen (D30).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `projectActions`
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * D29 shared the nine project-detail writes. Payment is not a tenth one. Every other write is a
 * single request whose worst outcome is "it didn't happen"; this one hands the viewer to a
 * third-party overlay OUTSIDE our DOM, takes real money there, and only THEN makes the request
 * that unlocks the screenplay. The failure that matters is the one in between: a charge the
 * gateway completed and a verification our client never delivered. Nothing else on the project
 * surface can fail that way, so it gets its own module rather than a section in a bigger one.
 *
 * SHAPE
 * -----
 * Same envelope as `projectActions` — `{ ok, data }` or `{ ok:false, message, status, flags }` —
 * because the two modules are called from the same screens and a second error convention would be
 * a second thing to remember. `fail` is imported rather than re-declared for the same reason.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
 * -----------------------------
 * No state, no hooks, no router, no `window.location`, no toast. `useProjectCheckout` owns the
 * state; the two screens own the presentation. The one browser dependency this module does keep is
 * `localStorage`, because the pending-charge record has to survive the page that wrote it (below).
