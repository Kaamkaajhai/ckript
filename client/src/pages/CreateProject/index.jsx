/*
 * THE CHROME SEAM (plan §11 Phase 3, mode B).
 *
 * Everything below this line — every piece of create-project state, the
 * autosave loop, the draft signature, the keepalive exit save, the working-draft
 * snapshot, validation, publish — is platform-neutral and is published through
 * `CreateProjectContext`. What is NOT neutral is the chrome that reads it:
 * `CreateProjectShell` is a three-pane desktop workspace, and a phone needs a
 * one-panel flow with a sticky footer.
 *
 * So the chrome is injected rather than forked. Two props, both defaulted so an
 * unchanged desktop call site (`<CreateProject />` in App.jsx) renders exactly
 * what it rendered before:
 *
 *   Shell         the chrome component. Desktop passes nothing and gets
 *                 CreateProjectShell; mobile passes its own.
 *   nativeChrome  the native chrome owns the modal surfaces listed below, so
 *                 this orchestrator must NOT also render its desktop ones. Two
 *                 exit confirmations stacked on one screen is worse than none,
 *                 and a `position: fixed` desktop toast lands on top of the
 *                 mobile editor's docked bar.
 *
 * `nativeChrome` suppresses exactly six surfaces, and each is replaced by a
 * mobile equivalent rather than dropped: the exit-as-draft confirmation
 * (→ ckm-action-sheet + ckm-confirm), the drafts drawer (→ a ckm-bottom-sheet),
 * the toast (→ the mobile ToastProvider), the under-review acknowledgement
 * (→ ckm-dialog), the thumbnail cropper (→ ckm-dialog) and the title-page
 * configurator (→ ckm-dialog). Nothing else is conditional: the grammar undo
 * bar and focus mode have no mobile caller and so can never open there, and
 * suppressing them would be dead code pretending to be a decision.
 *
 * One thing deliberately NOT suppressed: `VersionHistoryModal`. It is a shared
 * component with its own scroll and its own close, the mobile editor has no
 * control that opens it (version history is a Phase 3 bullet 4 sheet), and
 * hiding a surface nothing can reach would be the same dead code.
